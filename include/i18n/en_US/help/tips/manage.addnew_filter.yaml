        Think of these numbers as seat numbers when boarding an airplane. Just like
        First Class has lower seat numbers and boards the plane first, so here the
        lower the number the closer a Ticket Filter is to being the first Filter
        executed. You want to keep your strict and narrow filters (very small
        matches) first and your broad filters (large amount of matches) last. If
        you enable <span class='doc-desc-title'>Stop Processing Further on
        Match</span>, then only the first matching Filter will be applied.

    title: Target

        The Target is the source from whom the Ticket was created. So, for example,
        if you choose Web Forms, you are saying that you want to apply  the Ticket
        Filters to those tickets which originated from the Client Interface.

        If you would like the filter to match any of the rules, and then stop,
        choose Match Any. If you would like all rules of the filter to be matched,
        choose Match All.

    title: Basic Fields Criterion
    content: >
        The selectable options below this header are those elements which can be
        found in any standard Ticket. Note: the Email option here indicates from
        whom the Email was sent.
        
custom_fields_criterion:
    title: Custom Fields Criterion
    content: >
        The selectable options below this header are the Custom Fields found in the
        <span class='doc-desc-title'>Ticket Details</span> Form. If you would like
        to use one of your <span class='doc-desc-title'>Custom Lists</span> as a
        Field Criterion in your Ticket Filter, then you want to edit the Ticket
        Details Form by adding your Custom List to the Ticket Details Form Fields. 
        (To edit the Ticket Details Form, see Admin Panel -> Manage -> Forms ->
        Ticket Details).

reply_to_email:
    title: Reply-To Email
    content: >
        This field is only relevant if the Target selected above is an Email
        Address. When a Client opens a Ticket by sending an Email, the Client has
        the option to enable a Reply To field in their Email client (e.g,. Gmail,
        Outlook, etc.). This includes header information that informs the Inbound
        Email Client (i.e., recipient) that the Sender is requesting that the Reply
        be routed to a different Email Address from that which it was originally
        sent. If the <span class='doc-desc-title'>Reply-To Email</span> feature is
        enabled here, then osTicket will honor the Client’s request to respond to
        their noted alternative Email Address.

canned_response:

        This will cause an email to go out from the Default Email Address (or
        Department’s default if setting is enabled) with the Canned Response chosen
        here included in the Email. The <span class='doc-desc-title'>New Ticket
        Auto-Reply</span> Template in an Email Template Set will dictate how the
        Canned Response is included in that Email. What Email Template Set is used
        depends on what Template Set is assigned as Default, or to the relevant
        Department. (To edit Canned Responses, see Staff Panel -> Knowledgebase ->
        Canned Responses). (To edit the <span class='doc-desc-title'>New Ticket
        Auto-Reply</span> <span class='doc-desc-title'>Template</span>, see
