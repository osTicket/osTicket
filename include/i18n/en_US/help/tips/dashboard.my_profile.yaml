        What you create here will be an optional Signature that perhaps appears at
        the end of your Ticket Responses. Whether this Signature appears, or not,
        depends on the Email Template that will be used in a Ticket Response. (To
        create Email Templates, see Admin Panel -> Emails -> Templates ).
