        under a question group on your Lime Survey server.<br/>
        <strong>Make sure each question is hidden on your survey otherwise customers who click
        the survey link will be able to see and change the Ticket ID and Staff Name for the ticket
        that the survey relates to.</strong><br/><br/>
        I would reccomend setting up the TicketID and StaffID questions under the first question
        group you create in your Lime Survey server.<br/>

        <strong>Publication &amp; access control</strong> section of your survey options.
