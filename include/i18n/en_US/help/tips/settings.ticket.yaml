        This setting is used to generate ticket numbers. Use hash signs
        (`#`) where digits are to be placed. Any other text in the number
        format will be preserved. <span class="doc-desc-title">Help
        Topics</span> can define custom number formats.

        the survey link will be able to see and change the Ticket ID and Staff Name for the ticket
        that the survey relates to.</strong><br/><br/>
        I would reccomend setting up the TicketID and StaffID questions under the first question
        group you create in your Lime Survey server.<br/>

        <strong>Publication &amp; access control</strong> section of your survey options.
