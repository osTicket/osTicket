human_verification:
    title: Human Verification
    content: >
        Enable CAPTCHA on new web tickets. CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response
        test that typically only humans can pass. It displays a picture with text
        inside of it so a bot/spider cannot readily read the text like a human can.
        When the Client enters the text, it will check whether the Client’s input
        matches  the text inside the image. GDLib is a software graphics library
        that is required to run CAPTCHA. If you are using osTicket as a
        SupportSystem.com customer, you do not need to worry about installing
        GDLib. We have everything set up for you. Just enable CAPTCHA!
