        Select a date range to cause both the graph and the table (cf. <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Statistics</span>) below to focus on any
        corresponding data for those dates. The graph below will always reflect  a
        broad overview of the whole system’s data (i.e., population). However, you
        may navigate through the <span class="doc-desc-title">Statistics
        </span> table below to focus on a narrower subject of interest (e.g.,
        Department, Topics, or Staff). Additionally, you may export any data
        currently displayed in the <span class="doc-desc-title">Statistics
        </span> table.

report_timeframe:
    title: Report timeframe
    content: >
        Choose a start date for the desired data sample using the date picker.
        Then, choose the length of time from that date to
        define the end date for your data sample.

statistics:
    title: Statistics
    content: >
        Navigate to the subject of interest by clicking on the appropriate tab in
        order to view the specific sample of data. Within the table, the circles
        represent the size of the nominal data. Therefore, the larger the number in
        a particular cell, the larger the adjacent circle will be.

opened:
    title: Opened
    content: >
        This represents the tickets opened by Agents (i.e., internally opened) and
        not by Clients.

assigned:
    title: Assigned
    content: >
        The system tracks every event whereby a ticket is automatically or manually
        assigned to a particular Department or Agent. Automatic assignments will
        depend on established settings for <span class="doc-desc-title">Help
        Topics</span> and <span class="doc-desc-title">Email Filters</span> in the
        Admin Panel.

overdue:
    title: Overdue
    content: >
        This is the amount of tickets that have violated the SLA Plan to which they
        belonged.

closed:
    title: Closed
    content: >
        This is the amount of tickets that were closed.

reopened:
    title: Reopened
    content: >
        This is the amount of tickets that were reopened either by an Agent or by a
        Client when he/she responded while the ticket was in a Closed status.

service_time:
    title: Service Time
    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Service time</span> is the duration of time
        that begins at the opening of a ticket and ends when the ticket is closed.
        The <span class="doc-desc-title">Service Time</span> column here measures
        the average Service Time per ticket, in hours, within the specified date
        span.

response_time:
    title: Response Time
    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Response Time</span> is a duration of time
        that begins with any Client’s correspondence and ends when an Agent makes a
        response. This measurement of time is not exclusive to a Client’s
        correspondence of the initial Ticket opening. This refers to every act of
        discourse originating with a Client.

export:
    title: Export
    content: >
        You may export the data currently in view. Therefore,  the data that is
        exported will be a direct reflection of whatever date span and specific
        tabbed subject is currently specified when an <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Export</span> is requested. The file format is <span
        class="doc-desc-title">.csv</span>, which is compatible to any spreadsheet
        application.
